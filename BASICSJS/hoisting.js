// we use variable before initialization
// hoisting = variable and functions are hoisted which means there declaration 
// is move on the top of code. 
console.log(a); // undefined
console.log(b);// not defined
var a = 12;
/*
var a = declaration. => it go itself move on a top these is hoisting 
a = 12; initialization
*/
// undefined it means a variables does'nt have a values
// not defined = no variable is exist.
